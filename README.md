# Jazz Development Environment
## Introduction
Jazz Development Environment provides you with tooling for developing RTC Plugins. Main features include running a jetty server for hot deployment and live debugging of jazz plugins.

Setup and usage is handled in a convention over configuration style, which keeps editing files and dealing with setup to a minimum. It is mainly focused on how `jazz-community` plugins are developed, but all related tools are open sourced under the [jazz community](https://github.com/jazz-community/) organization.

For a more detailed tour of the features, please see the [wiki](link to features)
